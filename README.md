# Learn Pydantic AI

📦 This repository contains the source code for my tutorial series on [Pydantic AI](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai) — a framework for building structured and reliable AI Agents in Python.

📘 You can read the accompanying articles on dev.to, where I explain the concepts and design decisions behind each part [here](https://dev.to/hamluk).

## ⚙️ Setup and Usage

To get started, clone this repository and switch to the branch for the tutorial you want to explore.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hamluk/LearnPydanticAI.git
cd LearnPydanticAI
```

### 2. Switch to a tutorial branch

Each part of the series has its own branch, so you can directly see the corresponding code state:

```bash
git checkout part-1
```

### 3. Set up your environment

This project uses Poetry for dependency management. If you don’t have it installed yet:

```bash
pip install poetry
```

Then install the dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

### 4. Configure environment variables

Create a .env file in the project root and add your model API key and configuration:

```bash
LLM_MISTRAL_MODEL=<mistral_model>
MISTRAL_API_KEY=<mistral_api_key>
```

### 5. Run the example

Run the example script from the part you checked out:

```bash
poetry run python src/LearnPydanticAI/app.py
```

You should see structured output generated by your first AI Agent.

## 🧩 Project Structure

```bash
learn_pydanticai/
├── agent.py          # Core agent logic
├── model.py          # Pydantic model for structured output
├── app.py            # Entry point for running the example
└── __init__.py
```

Each branch includes small, focused updates based on the topic of that tutorial part.
